Repeat Macro
=========================

A Sublime text 2 and 3 plugin to repeat macro multiple times or till end of file.

Coming from Notepad++ it was really frustrating when I had to hold down on the repeat macro shortcut combination instead of just having it repeat itself. So got this ready in < 10 lines of coding, saving developers from hair loss due to frustration :)

Definitely open to suggestions and ideas to improve this :)

## How to use
Press default shortcut

* `Windows` and `Linux`: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>
* `Mac OS`: <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>

or search for 'RepeatMacro' in command browser
